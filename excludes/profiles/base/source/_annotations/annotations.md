# Please refer to https://fepper.io/docpage--pattern-annotations.html for
# documentation on annotating Fepper patterns. Fepper supports Front Matter
# (YAML + Markdown) syntax for annotations.

# This file is the source for global annotations. Annotations can also be added
# to patterns locally by writing .md files in the directories containing the
# patterns.
