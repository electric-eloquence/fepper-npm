# For Editors

Fepper gives Editors the ability to edit Markdown files directly in the UI. 
Click the eyeball icon on the right side of the top menu. Then click "CODE". The 
Code Viewer will open and, by default, will show the Feplet pane. Click on the 
"Markdown" tab and if the pattern has an associated `.md` file, its Markdown 
will be displayed. It can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button. If the 
project was set up with Git, the Editor can pull commits from remote and push 
commits from local.

Here's a hint to help edit content in Fepper: Dock the Code Viewer to the right 
or left side of the browser. It will stay open even after refreshing the browser.

Try viewing and even changing the Markdown on this page.
