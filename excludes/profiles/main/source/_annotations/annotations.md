# (YAML + Markdown) syntax for annotations.

# This file is the source for global annotations. Annotations can also be added
# to patterns locally by writing .md files in the directories containing the

Navigation for responsive web experiences can be tricky. Large navigation menus 
are typical on desktop sites, but mobile screen sizes don't give us the luxury 
of space. We're dealing with this situation by creating a simple menu anchor 
that toggles the main navigation on small screens. Once the screen size is large 
enough to accommodate the nav, we show the main navigation links and hide the 
menu anchor.
