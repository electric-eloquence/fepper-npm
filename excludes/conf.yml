# The "headed" conf is for internal Fepper development only. This allows
# fepper-npm to be installed with `npm link`. Uncomment for this purpose. The

# linking the npm. Other conditions do not need a flag. Furthermore, you need to 
# disable gulp in the fepper-npm/node_modules directory. Rename it to 
# "gulp-disabled". Rename it back to "gulp" when you need it again.
